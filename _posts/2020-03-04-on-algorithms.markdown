As I said in my past blog, I'm currently reading the book [**Algorithms for Dummies**][book-link]. I'm just at page 40 and I wanted to share what I have learned.

First, what's an algorithm? That one is easy, it's a sequence of steps two solve a problem. A recipe for a pancake it's an algorithm, as well as your morning routine might be one. An algorithm has to be:

* Finite
* Well-Defined
* Effective

I've been shown 3 types of algorithms, and for explaining them I want you to imagine you're in a library and want to find a book.

* Brute-Force: Go into every shelf of the library and check every book until you find it.

* Divide and Conquer: Divide the library into sections, then go into the desired section and look for the book in there

* Greedy: I've struggled to find an example that has to do with the library in here, maybe I haven't understood it, later we will come back to it.

So there you have it, the essential of those 40 pages, or at least what I have remembered. See you in the next post.

Happy Coding,
