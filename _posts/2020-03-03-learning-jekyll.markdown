I'll start saying my starting point, so hopefully, in a few years I can go back to this post and say, wow, I didn't know a thing. Not just about programming but about life in general. As I've stated in [First Post][first-post] I hope to write here weekly, and if I can every third day.

First, let's say where I am. I'm studying a bachelor of science in computer graphics and Systems Engineering. I'm currently in fourth semester and have high hopes for the future. Speaking of future, just the day before yesterday, I was wondering what did I wanted to do when I grew up, computer Science is such a broad topic, and one can get overwhelmed with all the different options, so after no so much thinking I realize 2 things.

* I don't want to work in web development (This might change in the future)
* I want to learn about data science.

And it's because that last point that I started this blog. I saw in a video that it's important to write what you have learned in a blog, so here it is. Also, that's what this blog it's especially planned to extracurricular learning. I don't expect two write about university so often, but if they teach us something related with the topics I'll try to cover in this blog, I'll be sure to write it down.

Right now, I know how to program in,

* C,C++
* Java
* Python

I also know a little about web development,

* HTML/CSS
* Javascript
* PHP

And I'm just learning SQL, but it's a high level language, so I think it will be easy.

I also have taken the course of Data Structure, learning about tree, graphs, lists, etc. And really like that. And actually that's what I want to focus right now. I'm reading the book **_Algorithms for Dummies_** by John Mueller and Luca Massaron. Those algorithms will be the topic for the next post.

So I hope I didn't bore you too much, and let's see where this take us.

Happy Cooding,
