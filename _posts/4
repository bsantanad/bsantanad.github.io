## _fstab_ File

During the boot process, file systems listed in _/etc/fstab_ are mounted, 
except for the ones containing _noauto_. The file contains entries on this 
format.

```bash

device  mount-point fstype  options dumpfreq    passno

```
Let's see them one by one:
* device: the device name, explained in the last post or [here][filename]
* mount-point: an existing directory in wich to mount the file system.
* fstype: The file system type to pass to [mount(8)][mount]
* options: either _rw_ or _ro_ (read and write or read only), then any other
option.
* dumpfreq: used by [dump(8)][dump] (file system backup), if missing zero is 
assumed.
* passno: determines order in which the file systems should be checked.
The root file system has 1, every other must be a number greater than 1.

```bash

    benja@generic:~ $ cat /etc/fstab
    # Custom /etc/fstab for FreeBSD embedded images
    /dev/ufs/rootfs   /       ufs     rw      1       1
    /dev/msdosfs/MSDOSBOOT /boot/msdos msdosfs rw,noatime 0 0
    tmpfs /tmp tmpfs rw,mode=1777,size=50m 0 0
