First of all, Hi, this is my first post in this blog that I expect it becomes into a weekly habit.
In here I will be posting a recap of what I learn in the week, I'm planning in this to be for just extracurricular learning, but if I learn something cool in University I will share it here. I hope writing my findings and knowledge will help store it better in my head, and who knows, maybe it will help someone one day.

I want to see how to paste links, [github][github-page].

[github-page]: https://github.com/benjaSantana

Also how to write some code

{% highlight python %}
	
	print("Hello World")	
	
{% endhighlight %}
