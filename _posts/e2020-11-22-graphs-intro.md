## Introduction

Here I'll take a few notes a [book][book] in graphs I'm currently reading,
the notes are for me so excuse the lack of explications.

## Definitions

* Graph: An object that consists in two sets, one named _edges_ and the
other one named _vertex_. This two being sets they must comply the rules
of sets, for more info check the start of the book.

* Edges and vertex: this is a _vertex_ set {A,G,H,Y,K}, this is a _edge_ set
{{A,H},{Y,K}}. We can respresent this with diagrams, to see this go page 20
of the book.

* Graphs are undirected otherwise they are called __bigraph__
* Graphs doesn't have loops otherwise they are called __pseudographs__ 
* Graphs doesn't have multiple edges between vertex otherwise they are 
called __multigraph__
